# PyLadies Blank GitHub Page Template

## Local Development

If you'd like to see your changes locally you can use `Python3` to serve up the content by:

```bash
$ cd /root-of-forked-directory
$ python -m http.server # Defaults to port 8000, you can change by providing an additional integer for the desired port
```

## Hosting your website on GitHub pages

GitHub provides a free hosted page for each [GitHub user](https://pages.github.com/). You can setup your page either via:

1. Using and creating a repo `github_username.github.io`. 
2. Using `gh-pages` branch, which is the default branch on this template. 

You can look at your repository > settings > GitHub Pages for more information on generating the `CNAME` file if you have a custom domain.
